               Saturday July 15.  Adelaide, Australia.

           What's Linux? What's FreeBSD? And Open Source? 
          Would you like some free, fully functional CDs?
 
      Come and see Open Source in action for yourself. Try it out!
 
    Do you want to try Linux on your computer, but are not sure you
        know enough to do it yourself?  Would you like someone
                 knowledgeable around - just in case?
 
        Have you installed Linux, but are stuck getting something
                 to work and don't know where to turn?
 
         Would you like to talk about Linux or Open Source with an
                     enthusiastic bunch of people?

          If you answered yes to any of these questions, then
       Installfest2000 is for you!  AUUG and LinuxSA are holding
        the opening event of the 'Australian Installfest Season' 
             in the centre of Adelaide, South Australia.
        See http://www.linux.org.au/installfest for full details.
 
    Everyone is welcome, whether you just want to see what Linux is
   all about, whether you want someone to install or configure Linux
    for you, or whether you're a seasoned open-source developer who
            can offer guidance and assistance to others.

      There will be a programme of 15-minute talks by experts on
           a variety of BSD, Linux and Open Source topics.
