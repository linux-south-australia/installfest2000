Hi installer,

You'll need PHP, postgres and apache for all this to work.

These pages assume a) that apache is running as user 'nobody'
                   b) that the database is called 'linuxsa'

To get the database up and going you need to :

psql linuxsa < database_create.in
psql linuxsa < database_create_2.in
