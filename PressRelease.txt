LinuxSA/AUUG InstallFest2000 Press Release

For Immediate Release


Adelaide, Australia -- Wednesday, June 28th, 2000 -- LinuxSA, in 
association with AUUG, announced its third InstallFest, to take place 
on Saturday 15th of July, 2000, to kick off the nationwide 
"InstallFest Season 2000".

LinuxSA and its sister user groups around the nation are co-ordinating to 
present InstallFests in every major city in Australia over July, August 
and September.
The purpose of these events is to give away as much free software as 
possible, in particular the Linux and FreeBSD operating systems.
Experienced Linux users will be on hand to help newer users install, 
configure and use their new software, and post-InstallFest help will be 
available from the LinuxSA mailing list.

Richard Russell, Event Coordinator for the LinuxSA/AUUG InstallFest 2000 
says, "There is a groundswell of support for an event like this here in 
Adelaide.  As Linux receives more and more publicity, people want to 
try it out for themselves.  That's where we come in, to help them out."
 
"The response from the local Linux community and from various commercial 
organisations", David Newall, Event Manager continues, "has simply been 
excellent.  We expect to be able to help several hundred individuals on 
the day to try out Linux for the first time."

InstallFest 2000 will be held in Agile Telecommunication's new exchange 
at 31 York St in the City.
Further details, including registration details and directions are 
available at the InstallFest webpage
